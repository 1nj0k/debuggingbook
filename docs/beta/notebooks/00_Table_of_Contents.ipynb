    "* <a href=\"StatisticalDebugger.ipynb\" title=\"Statistical Debugging (StatisticalDebugger)&#10;&#10;In this chapter, we introduce statistical debugging – the idea that specific events during execution could be statistically correlated with failures. We start with coverage of individual lines and then proceed towards further execution features.\">Statistical Debugging</a>\n",
    "* <a href=\"DynamicInvariants.ipynb\" title=\"Mining Function Specifications (DynamicInvariants)&#10;&#10;In the chapter on assertions, we have seen how important it is to check whether the result is as expected.  In this chapter, we introduce a technique that allows us to mine function specifications from a set of given executions, resulting in abstract and formal descriptions of what the function expects and what it delivers.\">Mining Function Specifications</a>\n",
    "* <a href=\"DDSetDebugger.ipynb\" title=\"Generalizing Failure Circumstances (DDSetDebugger)&#10;&#10;One central question in debugging is: Does this bug occur in other situations, too? In this chapter, we present a technique that is set to generalize the circumstances under which a failure occurs. The DDSET algorithm takes a failure-inducing input, breaks it into individual elements. For each element, it tries to find whether it can be replaced by others in the same category, and if so, it generalizes the concrete element to the very category. The result is a pattern that characterizes the failure condition: &quot;The failure occurs for all inputs of the form (&lt;expr&gt; * &lt;expr&gt;).\">Generalizing Failure Circumstances</a>\n",

    "* <a href=\"Tracking.ipynb\" title=\"Tracking Bugs (Tracking)&#10;&#10;So far, we have assumed that failures would be discovered and fixed by a single programmer during development. But what if the user who discovers a bug is different from the developer who eventually fixes it? In this case, users have to report bugs, and one needs to ensure that reported bugs are systematically tracked. This is the job of dedicated bug tracking systems, which we will discuss (and demo) in this chapter.\">Tracking Bugs</a>\n",
    "* <a href=\"ChangeCounter.ipynb\" title=\"Where the Bugs are (ChangeCounter)&#10;&#10;Every time a bug is fixed, developers leave a trace – in the version database when they commit the fix, or in the bug database when they close the bug. In this chapter, we learn how to mine these repositories for past changes and bugs, and how to map them to individual modules and functions, highlighting those project components that have seen most changes and fixes over time.\">Where the Bugs are</a>\n",
