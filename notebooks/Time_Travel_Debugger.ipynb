    "# Project Description\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project you will build your own **Time Travel Debugger** for Python. Please read the [Chapter on Debugging](https://www.debuggingbook.org/beta/html/Debugger.html) beforehand.\n",
    "A time travel debugger records a log of the process execution (including callstack and values of all variables at each step), so that it is possible to run it later\n",
    "with both forward and backward commands. The interactive session does not execute the code statements, but just replays all actions taken from the recorded execution.\n",
    "A time travel debugger can restore a full snapshot of each program state at any point in time and either continue the execution from then on, or run the program backward.\n",
    "As normal execution changes values of variables along the run, the backward execution reverts variables to the previous values and \"un-executes\" functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The project can be approached in two ways: either as a single-person project or a pair project.\n",
    "The single-person project comprises the implementation of a command line interface, whereas the pair project requires the implementation of a graphical user interface.\n",
    "To create a GUI in Jupyter notebooks, one can use embeddings of plain HTML/JS or consider Jupyter widgets [Jupyter widgets](https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "To be successful, you must obtain at least 15 points by implementing features listed in [Must-haves](#must-haves); otherwise, you will not be awarded any points for the project.\n",
    "To fully enjoy coding (and get maximum points) feel free to additionally implement some (or all) features from [May-haves](#may-haves) list.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Submission details\n",
    "\n",
    "The deadline for this project is on **the 18th of December, 2020 at 11:59pm CET**\n",
    "All files packaged in a zip archive must be uploaded via the CMS system.\n",
    "The project should be a self-contained bundle with the `TimeTravelDebugger.ipynb` Jupyter notebook and supplementary files.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Requirements\n",
    "The project should be implemented in a Jupyter notebook with a step-by-step explanation of the implemented features (like the notebooks from the lecture).\n",
    "The notebook should also include a \"Presentation\" section containing **demo interactions** which show how to use each feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "The project should setup a working environment via either `virtualenv` (*requirements.txt* file) or `pipenv` (*Pipfile.lock* file) tools.\n",
    "The code should follow PEP 8 style conventions. You can use `%%pycodestyle` command from [pycodestyle](https://pycodestyle.readthedocs.io) package to check files for PEP 8 compliance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The time travel debugger should be implemented as a class that can be executed as follows:\n",
    "```\n",
    "with TimeTravelDebugger():\n",
    "    foo(args)\n",
    "```\n",
    "where `foo(args)` can be an arbitrary function under debugging, implemented either in the same notebook or imported from another file.\n",
    "**Do not let the debugger escape the context and also debug commands outside the `with` block (e.g., methods of the Jupyter framework).**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## CLI based debugger (single-person project)\n",
    "The implementation should include an interactive command line interface, like the one presented in [Chapter on Debugging](https://www.debuggingbook.org/beta/html/Debugger.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Must-haves (20 points)\n",
    "The debugger should support the following features:\n",
    "\n",
    "Navigation commands:\n",
    "* /R0/ `quit` Quit\n",
    "Exit the interactive session\n",
    "* /R1/ `help` Help\n",
    "Prints all available commands and their description and arguments\n",
    "* /R2/ `step` Step to the next executed line\n",
    "Execute a program until it reaches the next executable statement.\n",
    "If the current line has a list comprehension statement, it should step into it, but remain at the current line (do not show `<listcomp>` source).\n",
    "If the current source line includes a function call, step into the called function and stop at the beginning of this function.\n",
    "* /R3/ `backstep` Step to the previous executed line\n",
    "Execute a program until it reaches the previous executable statement.\n",
    "If the current line has a list comprehension statement, it should step into it, but remain at the current line.\n",
    "If the current source line includes a function call, step into the called function and stop at the last statement invoked in this function (usually a return statement)\n",
    "* /R4/ `next` Step over function calls going to the next line\n",
    "Execute a program until it reaches the next source line. Any function calls (and list comprehension) in the current line should be executed without stopping.\n",
    "Starting from the last line of a function, this command should take you to its call site.\n",
    "* /R5/ `previous` Step over function calls going to the previous line\n",
    "Execute a program until it reaches the previous source line.\n",
    "If the line contains a function call, it should be “un-executed” restoring previous values of global variables.\n",
    "Starting from the first line of a function, `previous` should take you back to the caller of that function, before the function was called.\n",
    "Hint: The difference between `step` and `next` is that `step` will go inside a called function, while `next` stops at the next line of the **current** function. //list comprehension\n",
    "* /R6/ `finish` Execute until return\n",
    "Takes you forward to the point where the current function returns.\n",
    "* /R7/ `start` Execute until a function start\n",
    "Takes you backward to first instruction of the function.\n",
    "* Execute until a certain point:\n",
    "    * /R80/ `until <line_number>`\n",
    "    Resume execution until a line greater than `<line_number>` is reached.\n",
    "    If `<line_number>` is not given, resume execution until a line greater than the current is reached. This is useful to avoid stepping through multiple loop iterations.\n",
    "    If the execution jumps to another function act as `next`\n",
    "    * /R81/ `until <filename>:<line_number>`\n",
    "    Execute a program forward until it reaches the line with the number `<line_number>` in the file `<filename>`.\n",
    "    * /R82/ `backuntil <line_number>`\n",
    "    Resume execution backwards until a line lower than `<line_number>` in the current file is reached.\n",
    "    If `<line_number>` is not given, resume execution backwards until a line lower than the current is reached.\n",
    "    If the execution jumps to another function act as `previous`\n",
    "    * /R83/ `backuntil <filename>:<line_number>`\n",
    "    Execute a program backward until it reaches the line with the number `<line_number>` in the `<filename>`.\n",
    "    * /R84/ `funtil <function_name>`\n",
    "    Execute a program forward until it reaches the line with a call to the function named `<function_name>` in the current file.\n",
    "    * /R85/ `funtil <filename>:<function_name>`\n",
    "    Execute a program forward until it reaches the line with a call to the function named `<function_name>` in the file `<filename>`.\n",
    "    * /R86/ `backfuntil <function_name>`\n",
    "    Execute a program backward until it reaches the line with a call to the function named `<function_name>` in the current file.\n",
    "    * /R87/ `backfuntil <filename>:<function_name>`\n",
    "    Execute a program backward until it reaches the line with a call to the function named `<function_name>` in the `<filename>`.\n",
    "    * **Missing line numbers, function names, and file names should be processed appropriately (e.g., with error messages).**\n",
    "* /R9/ Continue execution forward until a breakpoint is hit, or the program finishes `continue`.\n",
    "* /R10/ Continue execution backward until a breakpoint is hit, or the program starts `reverse`.\n",
    "* After each navigation command (except `continue` and `reverse`) the current line should be printed.\n",
    "* Callstack\n",
    "    * /R110/ Print call stack:\n",
    "        * `where`\n",
    "        Print the whole call stack\n",
    "        * `where <number>`\n",
    "        Print the `<number>` of leading and trailing lines from the call stack surrounding the current frame if any.\n",
    "    * /R111/ Navigating the callstack\n",
    "        * `up` and `down`\n",
    "        Move up (and down) the call stack: print the code of the previous (next) frame and mark the currently executed line.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inspection commands:\n",
    "* /R12/ Print the source code around the current line (with the current line marked)\n",
    "    * `list`\n",
    "    Print 2 lines before and 2 lines after the current line\n",
    "    * `list <number>`\n",
    "    Print `<number>` lines before and `<number>` lines after the current line\n",
    "    * `list <above> <below>`\n",
    "    Print `<above>` lines before and `<below>` lines after the current line\n",
    "* /R13/ Inspect the value of a variable\n",
    "    * `print`\n",
    "    Print values of all local variables\n",
    "    * `print <var_name>`\n",
    "    Print the value of a variable with name `<var_name>`. If the variable `<var_name>` is not defined, print an error message.\n",
    "* /R140/ `watch <var_name>`\n",
    "Set a variable under watch: its value should be printed with each navigation command along with the current line.\n",
    "* /R141/ `unwatch <var_name>`\n",
    "Remove a watch.\n",
    "*Breakpoints:\n",
    "    * /R150/ `break <line_number>`\n",
    "    Create a breakpoint at line with number `<line_number>`\n",
    "    * /R1510/ `fbreak <function_name>`\n",
    "    Set a breakpoint which hits when a function with the name `<function_name>` is called (or returned in case of backward execution).\n",
    "    The execution should stop at the beginning (or the end) of the function.\n",
    "    * /R1511/ `fbreak '<file_name>:<function_name>`\n",
    "    Set a breakpoint which hits when a function with the name `<function_name>` in file `<file_name>` is called (or returned in case of backward execution).\n",

    "    Re-enable a breakpoint with the index `<breakpoint_id>` from the list of breakpoints\n",
    "    * /R157/ Conditional-breakpoints `cond <line> <condition>`\n",
    "    Set a breakpoint at which the execution is stopped at line `<line>` if a condition `<condition>` is true.\n",
    "    A condition can include local variables (e.g., `tag == \"b\"` or `tag.startswith(b)`), but not function calls from a debugged program.\n",
    "    * **Hint: keep in mind that breakpoints may be set in different modules (files) and sometimes cannot be set (e.g., in for comment lines).**\n",
    "\n",
    "### May-haves (10 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Expressions:\n",
    "    * `expr <expression_code>`\n",
    "Set an expression under watch: its evaluated value should be printed with each navigation command along with the current line.\n",
    "Keep in mind that this requires to compile the expression and run it during the interactive session, which may produce exceptions.\n",
    "Besides, if the code in the expression includes a function call from the code under debugging the current environment should be taken into account.\n",
    "    * `expressions`\n",

    "* Support for inline breakpoints (e.g., for lambda functions, list comprehension) if a line contains multiple statements such as `filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, [x**2 for x in range(10)])`\n",
    "* Watch I/O interaction\n",
    "* Stand-alone command line debugger, which can be used outside Jupyter notebooks\n",
    "* Some other cool feature of your own design\n",
    "\n",
    "## GUI based debugger (two-person project)\n",
    "GUI based debugger should implement the same features as the CLI debugger, but exposed via GUI interaction (instead of typing in the commands).\n",
    "For instance, a user can step backward by clicking the ◀ button, or set a breakpoint clicking on a line in the code view.\n",
    "The \"Presentation\" section should include video/YouTube (up to 1min each) embedded in Jupyter Notebook, which shows a demo of each implemented feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast to the CLI debugger, the GUI-based one shows all code, variables, stack, and breakpoints at once.\n",
    "### Must haves (20 points):\n",
    "* The must-haves from the one-person project have to be implemented in the GUI to be awarded points.\n",
    "* Windows:\n",
    "    * A view with the source code block under execution, where the current line is highlighted.\n",
    "    * A view for variables.\n",
    "    * A view for watches, if there is at least one watch.\n",
    "    * A view for the call stack.\n",
    "    * A view for breakpoints.\n",
    "* Able to scroll through the code\n",
    "* Controls:\n",
    "    * An interactive timeline (e.g., a slider) which allows moving along the execution back and forth.\n",
    "    * Automatic execution replay (forward and backward) at various speed\n",
    "    * Search for specific events (a breakpoint hit, a variable changed etc.) (which would be highlighted on the timeline)\n",
    "    * All commands described in the single-project are substituted with the UI controls (e.g. buttons, input fields, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a demo of how the simple GUI may look like:\n",
    "![Demo](PICS/timetravel_debugger_gui_demo.gif)\n",
    "### May haves (10 points):\n",
    "  * May-haves from CLI project.\n",
    "  * Syntax-highlighted source.\n",
    "  * Inline values of the variables in the source code.\n",
    "  * Add events (e.g., breakpoints) on the timeline.\n",
    "  * visualize and explore data structures.\n",
    "  * Produce an interactive session which can be run uniquely with HTML + JavaScript, such that Python is not required (excludes the evaluation of expressions) (worth up to 10 points).\n",
    "  * A debugger is implemented as a [custom Jupyter widget](https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples/Widget%20Custom.html) (worth up to 10 points).\n",
    "  * some other cool feature of your design."
