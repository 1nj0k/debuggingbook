    "If you are on Windows, consider using [pyenv-win](https://github.com/pyenv-win/pyenv-win) instead.\n",

    "Otherwise, Pipenv will use your system interpreter, which may or may not be the right version.\n",
    "1. Run `pipenv install -r requirements.txt` in the debuggingbook root directory.\n",
