    "In the previous chapters on [tracing](Tracer.ipynb) and [interactive debugging](Debugger.ipynb), we have seen how to observe executions. By checking our observations against our expectations, we can find out when and how the program state is faulty. So far, we have assumed that this check would be done by _humans_ – that is, us. However, having this check done by a _computer_, for instance as part of the execution, is infinitely more rigorous and efficient. In this chapter, we introduce techniques to _specify_ our expectations and to check them at runtime, enabling us to detect faults _right as they occur_."

    "[Tracers](Tracer.ipynb) and [Interactive Debuggers](Debugger.ipynb) are very flexible tools that allow you to observe precisely what happens during a program execution. It is still _you_, however, who has to check program states and traces against your expectations. There is nothing wrong with that – except that checking hundreds of statements or variables can quickly become a pretty boring and tedious task.\n",
