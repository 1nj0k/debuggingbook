The idea of systematically reducing inputs has been discovered a number of times, although not as  automatic and generic as delta debugging. \\cite{Slutz1998}, for instance, discusses systematic reduction of SQL statements for SQL databases; the general process as manual work is well described by \\cite{Kernighan1999}."

    "The deficits of delta debugging as it comes to syntactically complex inputs were first discussed in *compiler testing*, and _reducing tree inputs_ rather than string inputs was quickly discovered as an alternative.  *Hierarchical Delta Debugging* (*HDD*) \\cite{Misherghi2006} applies delta debugging on subtrees of a parse tree, systematically reducing a parse tree to a minimum.  _Generalized Tree Reduction_ \\cite{Herfert2017} generalizes this idea to apply arbitrary _patterns_ such as replacing a term by a compatible term in a subtree.  Using _grammars_ to reduce inputs was first implemented in the _Perses_ tool \\cite{Sun2018}."

    "While applying delta debugging to code lines does a decent job, _syntactic_ and especially _language-specific_ approaches can do a much better job for the programming language at hand.  *C-Reduce* \\cite{Regehr2012} is a reducer specifically targeting the reduction of programming languages.  Besides reductions in the style of delta debugging or tree transformations, C-Reduce comes with more than 30 source-to-source transformations that replace aggregates by scalars, remove function parameters at a definition and all call sites, change functions to return `void` and deleting all `return` statements, and many more.  While specifically instantiated for the C language (and used for testing C compilers), these principles extend to arbitrary programming languages following an ALGOL-like syntax.  When testing a compiler, C-Reduce is the tool to go for."
