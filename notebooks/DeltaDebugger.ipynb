In the best case (when the left half or the right half fails), the number of tests is logarithmic proportional to the length $n$ of an input (i.e., $O(\\log_2 n)$); this is the same complexity as binary search.  In the worst case, though, delta debugging can require a number of tests proportional to $n^2$  (i.e., $O(n^2)$) – this happens in the case when we are down to character granularity, and we have to repeatedly tried to delete all characters, only to find that deleting the last character results in a failure \\cite{Zeller2002}.

    "The \"lexical\" delta debugging algorithm discussed here stems from \\cite{Zeller2002}; actually, this is the exact Python implementation as used by Zeller in 2002.  The idea of systematically reducing inputs has been discovered a number of times, although not as  automatic and generic as delta debugging. \\cite{Slutz1998}, for instance, discusses systematic reduction of SQL statements for SQL databases; the general process as manual work is well described by \\cite{Kernighan1999}."

    "The deficits of delta debugging as it comes to syntactically complex inputs were first discussed in *compiler testing*, and _reducing tree inputs_ rather than string inputs was quickly discovered as an alternative.  *Hierarchical Delta Debugging* (*HDD*) \\cite{Misherghi2006} applies delta debugging on subtrees of a parse tree, systematically reducing a parse tree to a minimum.  _Generalized Tree Reduction_ \\cite{Herfert2017} generalizes this idea to apply arbitrary _patterns_ such as replacing a term by a compatible term in a subtree, as `subtrees_with_symbol()` does.  Using _grammars_ to reduce inputs was first implemented in the _Perses_ tool \\cite{Sun2018}; our algorithm implements very similar strategies.  Searching for alternate expansions (as `alternate_reductions()`) is a contribution of the present chapter."

    "While `GrammarReducer` is a generic approach that can be parameterized with an arbitrary grammar, _language-specific_ approaches can do a much better job for the language at hand.  *C-Reduce* \\cite{Regehr2012} is a reducer specifically targeting the reduction of programming languages.  Besides reductions in the style of delta debugging or tree transformations, C-Reduce comes with more than 30 source-to-source transformations that replace aggregates by scalars, remove function parameters at a definition and all call sites, change functions to return `void` and deleting all `return` statements, and many more.  While specifically instantiated for the C language (and used for testing C compilers), these principles extend to arbitrary programming languages following an ALGOL-like syntax.  When testing a compiler, C-Reduce is the tool to go for."
