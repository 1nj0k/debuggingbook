    "In this project, you will develop and implement a tool of your choice.\n",
    "Your project should focus on techniques **not** covered by the previous projects, notably:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Asserting Expectations\n",
    "* Tracking Failure Origins\n",
    "* Isolating Failure-Inducing Changes\n",
    "* Statistical Debugging\n",
    "* Mining Function Specifications\n",
    "* Generalizing Failure Circumstances\n",
    "* Where the Bugs are\n",
    "\n",
    "To get an idea on what the expectations are, here are some suggestions for concrete project ideas:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Enforcing Flows. Set up a system that asserts that specific data flows should (or should not) take place (“There should be no data flow from password to output”). Combines [assertions](Assertions.ipynb) and [slices](Slicer.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Statistical Dependencies. Associate the presence (or absence) of data flows/dependencies with failures (“This program fails when there is a flow between A and B”). Combines [slices](Slicer.ipynb) and [statistical debugging](StatisticalDebugger.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Statistical Invariant Properties. Using the invariant templates (say, X < Y) from [dynamic invariants](DynamicInvariants.ipynb), find out which properties correlate with failure, as in [statistical debugging](StatisticalDebugger.ipynb): “middle() fails when x < z < y”.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Exploring Flows. Add commands to the [interactive debugger](Debugger.ipynb) such that one can track where a particular value came from, using [slicer](Slicer.ipynb): “enter 'origin x’; get ‘from y in Line 35’)\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Mining Co-Changes. Pick some git project. Which files are most frequently changed together? Visualize. Uses [mining changes](ChangeCounter.ipynb): “Sitemap.html and 404.html are always changed together”\n",
    "\n",
    "You can pick one of the above ideas or suggest one of your own.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can either work alone or form a team of two people. Keep in mind, a pair project should be **sufficiently sophisticated** for two persons."

To be able to work on your own project idea, you need to hand in the proposal by **Wednesday, February 10, 23:59**. We will then notify you, whether your project idea is approved, is approved with changes, or is rejected. If we approve it with changes, you need to agree to the changes we proposed.
